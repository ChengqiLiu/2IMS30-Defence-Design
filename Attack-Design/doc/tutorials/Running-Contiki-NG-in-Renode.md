# Running Contiki‚ÄêNG in Renode

[Renode](http://renode.io) is a virtual development tool for multinode embedded networks (both wired and wireless) enabling a scalable workflow for building effective, tested and secure IoT systems, created by [Antmicro](http://antmicro.com/blog/2017/08/renode-press-release/).
It can easily be used to run, debug and test your Contiki-NG applications without any changes in the code itself, as if you were running on real hardware - but with more possibilities.

Renode has been used by various entities including Antmicro and RISE SICS for Contiki-NG development.

Renode is readily available in the Contiki-NG [Docker image](/doc/getting-started/Docker).
If you prefer a native install of Renode, follow the instructions from the [Renode project README](https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/README.rst#installation).

## Starting Renode

### Running from the Contiki-NG tree

To start an example that is provided directly in the Contiki-NG tree, go to
`/examples/rpl-udp` and run `make renode TARGET=cc2538dk`. This will
run the `rpl-udp.resc` script in Renode with the binaries built from the sources
of the rpl-udp example. The script instantiates one virtual server node and one
virtual client node which run the respective binaries.

If you want to supply a different script, just use:

    $ make renode TARGET=cc2538dk SCRIPT=<SCRIPT_NAME>

### Running Renode from an arbitrary location

To start Renode just use the `renode` command.
You will see "the Monitor" - the CLI for Renode.
To load the demo mentioned in the previous section run:

    i @/path/to/contiki-ng/examples/rpl-udp/rpl-udp.resc

This will load the default `rpl-udp` Contiki-NG demo binaries, provided they have been built.
In Renode, the "@" sign represents a path to a file.
To change one of the binaries edit the line in the script file where the binary is set:

    $bin=@path_to_your_binary

This goes before the line that includes the script for the particular machine
(which you also might want to change):

    i $ORIGIN/cc2538-node.resc

(`$ORIGIN` is the directory where the current script is located)

Please keep in mind that changing the `$bin` variable will affect all
subsequent machines. However, you can change it many times in one
script.

## Using Renode

When starting Renode with `rpl-udp.resc`, first the Renode terminal window will open, followed by one window for each node in the simulation:

From the Renode terminal, start the simulation by running `start` (or `s` -- all commands have a shorthand).
You can pause the simulation with `pause`, or quit with `quit`.
The simulation is now running, and the node output confirms transmission and reception of UDP traffic over RPL:

Depending on your setup, the simulation might be slow -- try decreasing `START_INTERVAL` and `SEND_INTERVAL` to e.g. 5s in `rpl-udp.c` for quicker feedback.
To check simulation time, first set you context to one of the virtual machines, e.g. machine 0 with `mach set 0`. Then, use `machine ElapsedVirtualTime` and `machine ElapsedHostTime`.
Note: `mach clear` returns to the main Renode monitor.

You can also inspect the wireless traffic with Wireshark. Try `emulation LogWirelessTraffic`. Note: on Linux, your user must be in group `wireshark`. A Wireshark window will open, showing all traffic in the simulation. Note: on OS-X the wireshark feature is not currently available.
