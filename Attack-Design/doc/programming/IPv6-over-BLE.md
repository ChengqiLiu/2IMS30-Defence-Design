# IPv6 over BLE

## Overview
In 2015, the IETF released the [RFC 7668](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) that specifies how IPv6 packets can be exchanged using BLE connections (IPv6 over BLE). This Contiki-NG extenstion implements [BLEach](http://www.iti.tugraz.at/BLEach), a fully open-source IPv6-over-BLE stack for Contiki-NG. Currently, BLEach can be used for IPv6-over-BLE node devices that act as a BLE slave device.

It was developed by

* [Michael Sp√∂rk](http://michaelspoerk.com/?utm_source=contiki-ng-wiki), Graz University of Technology, michael.spoerk@tugraz.at, github user: spoerk

This IPv6-over-BLE stack is presented and evaluated in the paper: [BLEach: Exploiting the Full Potential of IPv6 over BLE in Constrained Embedded IoT Devices](https://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~mzimmerl/pubs/spoerk17bleach.pdf), ACM SenSys'17.

## Features
This implementation includes:
  * IPv6-over-BLE node implementation compliant to [RFC 7668][rfc7668]
  	* connect to a single IPv6-over-BLE border router
  	* maximum IPv6 packet length of 1280 bytes
  	* BLE L2CAP channels in LE credit-based flow control mode
  * BLE link layer support for version [4.1][bleSpec]:
  	* BLE advertisement
  	* BLE initiating
  	* BLE connection slave
  	* BLE connection master

It has been tested on the TI CC2650 SensorTag and the TI CC2650 LaunchPad hardware.

## Modules
BLEach comes with the following modules:

### BLE radio
The implementation of the BLE radio for the TI CC26xx platform is implemented in `arch/cpu/cc26xx-cc13xx/rf-core/ble-cc2650.c`
and `arch/cpu/cc26xx-cc13xx/rf-core/ble-hal/*.[ch]`.
These files contain all the hardware specific code for supporting BLE as a link layer.


### BLE L2CAP layer
The L2CAP LE credit-based flow control support is implemented in `os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.h` and `os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c`.
Besides implementing rudimentary L2CAP support, this module handles fragmentation of large IPv6 packets.

## Using BLEach
A simple IPv6-over-BLE UDP-client is included under `examples/ble/ipv6-client`.

For IPv6-over-BLE support, IPv6 needs to be enabled and RPL needs to disabled in Contiki-NG:
```
MAKE_MAC = MAKE_MAC_BLE
MAKE_NET = MAKE_NET_IPV6
```

Currently, BLEach is only available for the Texas Instruments CC2650 hardware platform.

The following sections describe how to configure BLEach for IPv6-over-BLE nodes.

### IPv6-over-BLE node (BLE slave)
To enable IPv6 over BLE, the project configuration needs to contain:
```
#define PACKETBUF_CONF_SIZE                  	1280
#define QUEUEBUF_CONF_NUM                       1
#define UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE                 	1280

#define NETSTACK_CONF_RADIO             	ble_cc2650_driver

/* 6LoWPAN settings */
#define SICSLOWPAN_CONF_MAC_MAX_PAYLOAD      	1280
#define SICSLOWPAN_CONF_COMPRESSION          	SICSLOWPAN_COMPRESSION_HC06
#define SICSLOWPAN_CONF_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD   0  /* always use compression */
#define SICSLOWPAN_CONF_FRAG                    0
#define SICSLOWPAN_FRAMER_HDRLEN                0

/* network stack settings */
#define UIP_CONF_ROUTER                         0
#define UIP_CONF_ND6_SEND_NA 			1

```

The following optional parameter can be used to configure that BLE advertisement behaviour:
```
#define BLE_CONF_DEVICE_NAME					"TI CC26xx device"
#define BLE_CONF_ADV_INTERVAL					25
```
`BLE_CONF_DEVICE_NAME` holds the device name that is used for advertisement, `BLE_CONF_ADV_INTERVAL`
specifies the used advertisement interval in milliseconds.
