# EZSP SPI Bootloader

Standalone Bootloader using the EZSP protocol over SPI. This is the recommended SPI bootloader for the EmberZNet and Connect protocol stacks.

The EZSP-SPI Protocol uses a 4-wire SPI interface to communicate between the host processor and NCP, plus an additional pair of GPIOs for handshake signaling in each direction.
