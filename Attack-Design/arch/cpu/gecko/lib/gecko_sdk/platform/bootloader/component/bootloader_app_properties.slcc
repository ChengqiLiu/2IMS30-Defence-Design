description: >
  The application properties struct is needed for an application that wishes to generate into a GBL file using the Commander utility and the --app option.
  The struct in the application is used to declare the application version, application type, whether the application image is signed, what type of signature is used, etc.

  Note: This component is added as a dependency when the Bootloader Application Interface component is added to the project. It is not recommended to install this component
  independently, without installing the Bootloader Application Interface component
