 * @brief BT Mesh Configuration Executor executes configuration jobs by executing
 *   the tasks in the task tree of the configuration job.
 *
 * Each executor shall have one parent @ref btmesh_conf_distributor.
 * Parent distributor can command the executor to start configuration job
 * execution by calling @ref btmesh_conf_executor_start_job function.
 * The configuration executor reports the status of job execution by calling
 * @ref btmesh_conf_distributor_on_job_notification function of parent distributor.
 *
 * The relationship between the configuration distributor and its executors is
 * composition so the executors are owned by its parent distributor completely.
 * Only the parent distributor is allowed to start configuration jobs because
 * the executors always report its job statuses to the parent distributor.
 *
 * The robust execution of configuration tasks is guaranteed by the retry
 * mechanism of the executor.
 * @n Retry mechanism is used in the following cases:
 *   - Configuration request timeout in the BT Mesh Stack due to the following:
 *     - BT Mesh message sent to the configuration server is lost
 *     - BT Mesh status message sent by the configuration server is lost
 *   - Configuration event is not received maybe due to event lost over
 *     NCP communication (quite rare)
 *   - Configuration request is busy due to unavailable resources in the
 *     BT Mesh Stack
