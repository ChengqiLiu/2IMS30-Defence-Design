description: >
  Used to support the functionality of a node that can monitor sensor data and
  configure a set of sensors on another node.
  
  Sensor Client can connect to multiple Sensor Servers. It may operate on states
  defined by Sensor Server model and Sensor Setup model via Sensor messages.
  
  This component supports temperature, people count, and illuminance data. It
  provides callback functions for receiving these data, for events, such as
  when Sensor Server discovery has started, when a device is found.
  There is an interface to change the current property listened to and request
  data on said property.
