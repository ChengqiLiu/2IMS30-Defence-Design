label: Constant Tone Extension GATT Service (Silabs proprietary)
package: Bluetooth
description: >
  Constant Tone Extension GATT Service reference implementation for extended advertising.

  This Silabs proprietary solution uses the same characteristics as the standard Bluetooth SIG solution.

  Limitations:

  - The specification expects to maintain a list about the characteristic values for each client
  and take the largest/smallest value. Insted of this the latest valid value will take effect.

  - The Advertising Constant Tone Extension Transmit Duration characteristic is not implemented.
