description: >
 The Factory Reset is an application-level software module that
 manages two types of device resets. The Factory Reset provides possibility
 for node reset and full reset. Node reset removes all the keys and other
 settings that have been configured for this node previously. Full reset removes
 all NVM data as well. Callback is available for both reset types. After callback
 execution the node reboots itself. After reboot in both reset cases the node
 enters to unprovisioned state. These interface functions are available also
 for CLI calls.
