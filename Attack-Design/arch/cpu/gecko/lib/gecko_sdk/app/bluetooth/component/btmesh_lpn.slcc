description: >
  Low Power component enables Bluetooth Mesh Low Power Node (LPN) Feature for the node.
  LPNs consume less power by remaining in sleep for the majority of their operation cycle,
  waking up to poll incoming messages from a Friend Node. LPN operation can be achieved only by having an established friendship.
  Numerous timing and queue parameters can be configured in Simplicity Studio, more details can be found on the configuration panel
  or in sl_btmesh_lpn_config.h. Several callback functions, which can be implemented in the application,
  are available for initialization and friendship related events. More details about the functions can be found in sl_btmesh_lpn.h.
  LPN functionality can be enabled or disabled during runtime via node configuration.
