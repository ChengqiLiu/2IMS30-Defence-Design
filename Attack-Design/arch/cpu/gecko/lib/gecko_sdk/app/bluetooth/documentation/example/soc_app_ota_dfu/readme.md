# SoC - Appication OTA DFU

 This example project demonstrates the Application Over-the-Air Device Firmware Upgrade (OTA DFU) service, which unlocks firmware update during application runtime without resetting the device into 'OTA DFU mode' and without installing any application loader utility to the device. The downloaded firmware is stored in dedicated flash storage (slot 0). Once the download has finished, the bootloader is configured to update the firmware on the device. During the reboot session the new firmware is copied to the application space in the flash and the new application is loaded.


## Getting Started

To learn the Bluetooth technology basics, see [UG103.14: Bluetooth® LE Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-14-fundamentals-ble.pdf).

To get started with Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth® Quick-Start Guide for SDK v3.x and Higher](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

OTA DFU means that the firmware upgrade image is sent to the device via a Bluetooth connection. The new firmware can be uploaded either by Apploader (a standalone Bluetooth application that runs in the bootloader or on its own) or by the user application. Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages.
* Apploader runs independently of the user application and it can overwrite the old application right away without an internal step. This is useful if there is no extra storage space. It is also a safe solution, because even if there is a serious bug in the user application, the device can still be started in DFU mode, and a new firmware can be installed without issues.
* Application OTA DFU means that the image is uploaded during the user application's runtime. This needs extra storage space (since the application cannot overwrite itself). On the other hand, it allows for checking the firmware upgrade image validity before the image is installed and it offers more configurability and interactivity during the DFU sequence.

This example project demonstrates Application OTA DFU, i.e. how to upload and install a new firmware image from the user application using the proper software components.

To learn more about Device Firmware Upgrade, see [AN1086: Using the Gecko Bootloader with the Silicon Labs Bluetooth® Applications](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1086-gecko-bootloader-bluetooth.pdf).


## Features Implemented in the Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Application OTA DFU software component.

* A simple application is implemented in the event handler function that starts advertising on boot (and on connection_closed event). This makes it possible for remote devices to find the device and connect to it.

* A simple serial port-based logger component is added to the project that comes handy for debugging and testing the application OTA features.

* A simple GATT database is defined by adding Generic Access and Device Information services. This makes it possible for remote devices to read out some basic information e.g., the device name.

* The application OTA software component is added, which extends both the event handlers (see sl_app_ota.c) and the GATT database (OTA DFU service). This enables OTA application updates during runtime without any additional application code.

By deafult, the Application OTA DFU software component takes care of the full OTA DFU process. It manages the upload process and it interfaces with the bootloader. The main application (app.c) only extends this component with some nice-to-have features - such as progress reporting and error handling - and takes care of the device reboot. The developer is free to modify this code.


## Testing the Example

This is a minimal example with the application OTA service that allows it to do a firmware update during runtime. There is no need to change to 'OTA mode' and no Apploader utility is required. Once the new firmware is downloaded to the device, a restart will happen and the new firmware will overwrite the original application content. The application OTA example has to be uploaded to a device that already has an **internal storage bootloader** with at least **one configured flash storage** (slot 0) with enough capacity to store the new firmware. When started, the application first checks this flash storage and if necessary it will erase its content. When the OTA update finished and reboot is done, this storage will be cleared again if necessary. To test this update feature do the following:

1. Build and flash an internal storage bootloader to your device. (See Troubleshooting section.)
2. Build and flash the SoC-Application-OTA-DFU sample app to your device.
3. Create the full.gbl firmware upgrade file with the create_bl_files.bat/.sh script, which is part of your project. If it does not work, see the instructions in [AN1086: Using the Gecko Bootloader with the Silicon Labs Bluetooth® Applications](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1086-gecko-bootloader-bluetooth.pdf).
4. Save full.gbl outside of your project for later use.
5. Modify the code so that you can differentiate the old and the new firmware (e.g., change the first app_log message in app_init() function or change the device name in the GATT database). 
6. Build the project again, but do not flash.
7. Create a new full.gbl file with create_bl_files.bat/.sh.
8. Open a terminal program and connect to your radio board via the JLink adapter to see the debug messages.
9. Download the **EFR Connect** smartphone application available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/efr-connect/id1030932759) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconlabs.bledemo).
10. Open the app and choose the Bluetooth Browser.
   ![EFR Connect start screen](readme_img2.png)
11. Now you should find your device advertising as "Application OTA". Tap **Connect**.
   ![Bluetooth Browser](readme_img3.png)
12. The connection is opened, and the GATT database is automatically discovered. Find the device name characteristic under Generic Access service and try to read out the device name.
   ![GATT database of the device](readme_img4.png)
13. Select the 3 dots menu and choose OTA DFU.
   ![OTA DFU menu](readme_img5.png)
14. Use the Partial OTA tab (default)
   ![Select gbl file](readme_img6.png)
15. Select the full.gbl file and tap **OTA** to start the OTA transfer.
16. Once its done tap **END** to finalize the process.
17. Press push button 0 on your kit to restart your device. The bootloader will automatically install the new firmware image.
18. Check if the new firmware is started either by checking the (modified) device name in EFR Connect or by checking the (modified) logs in the terminal.


## Troubleshooting

Note that __NO__ Bootloader is included in any Software Example projects, but they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, you should either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, you should either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled Demos flash both bootloader and application images to your device.

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to your device, *SoC-Thermometer* demo can be flashed before your application to load the bootloader.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to your device, *NCP* demo can be flashed before your application to load the bootloader.
- For your custom application, create your own bootloader project and flash it to your device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done in one step by flashing the **-combined.s37** file found in your bootloader project after building the project.

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side), as shown below.
