description: >
  Friend component enables Bluetooth Mesh Friend Feature for the node. Friend nodes are required when
  Low Power Nodes (LPN) are present in the mesh network. When a friendship is established between an LPN and Friend node,
  the friend node starts to store incoming messages targeted for the LPN. These mesages are forwarded to the LPN upon request.
  Logging for these messages can be enabled as a configuration option in Simplicity Studio.
  Callback functions are provided for friendship establishment and termination.
  Friend functionality can be enabled or disabled during runtime via node configuration.
