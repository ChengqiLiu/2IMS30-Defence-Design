# Hall Effect Demo Code for the Si72xx-WD-Kit Using Silicon Labs SLSTK3400A-EFM32HG Starter Kit

You need the Hall Effect Evaluation kit and Si72xx-WD-Kit for
this demo. The Si72xx-WD-Kit includes two Si7210 sensors mounted on an 
expansion board (Si72xx-EXP) plus each of the six base part types mounted on 
small postage-stamp-sized (PS) boards. You must use the Silicon Labs 
SLSTK3400A-EFM32HG Starter Kit, which is included in the Si72xx-WD-Kit.

This example includes eight demos, two for the Si72xx-EXP and one for each of 
the PS-boards. Individual files are included to measure and convert the sensor 
outputs into magnetic field readings for the Si7211-EB, Si7212-EB and Si7213-EB
boards. The Si72xx-EXP and Si7210-EB boards use the Silicon Labs Hall Effect 
Sensor driver to demonstrate the sensor's features by communicating over I2C. 

**Note**: For a complete list of demos and their descriptions, see
the Si72xx-WD-Kit User's Guide, UG288.
