# SE Manager Tamper


This example uses the SE Manager API to demonstrate the tamper feature on the supported Series 2 Secure Vault High device.


For demonstration purposes, a private command key is stored in the device’s memory to sign the access certificate for tamper disable. The device’s public command key in the SE OTP must match with the public key of this private command key to disable tamper signals.


The default private command key (`cmd-unsafe-privkey.pem`) in PEM format can be found in the Windows folder below.


*C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\adapter\_packs\secmgr\scripts\offline*


The public key of `cmd-unsafe-privkey.pem` in text format is:


`X - B1BC6F6FA56640ED522B2EE0F5B3CF7E5D48F60BE8148F0DC08440F0A4E1DCA4`


`Y - 7C04119ED6A1BE31B7707E5F9D001A659A051003E95E1B936F05C37EA793AD63`


If the device does not have a public command key in the SE OTP, the program will prompt the user to program the public key above to the device.


The user can change the private command key (`private_command_key[]`) in `app_se_manager_tamper_disable.c` to match with the device’s public command key in the SE OTP for tamper disable.


The example redirects standard I/O to the virtual serial port (VCOM) of the kit. By default, the serial port setting is 115200 bps and 8-N-1 configuration.


The example has been instrumented with code to count the number of clock cycles spent in different operations. The results are printed on the VCOM serial port console. This feature can be disabled by defining `SE_MANAGER_PRINT=0` (default is 1) in the IDE setting (`Preprocessor->Defined symbols`).


## Tamper Responses




| Level | Responses | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Ignore | No action is taken |
| 1 | Interrupt | The SETAMPERHOST interrupt on the host is triggered |
| 2 | Filter | A counter in the tamper filter is increased |
| 4 | Reset | The device is reset |
| 7 | Erase OTP | Erases the OTP configuration of the device (make the device and all wrapped secrets unrecoverable) |

| 18 | PRS2 | 0 | 2 (Push button PB0) |
| 19 | PRS3 | 0 | 2 (None) |
| 20 | PRS4 | 0 | 4 (Push button PB1) |
| 21 | PRS5 | 0 | 4 (Software) |
| 22 | PRS6 | 0 | 7 (None) |
| 23 | PRS7 | 0 | 7 (None) |
| 24 | DECOUPLE BOD | 4 | 4 |
| 25 | TempSensor | 0 | 2 |
| 26 | VGlitch Falling | 0 | 2 |
| 27 | VGlitch Rising | 0 | 2 |
| 28 | SecureLock | 4 | 4 |
| 29 | SE Debug | 0 | 0 |
| 30 | Digital glitch | 0 | 2 |
| 31 | SE ICACHE | 4 | 4 |


The disable tamper command simply reverts all masked tamper sources (`TAMPER_DISABLE_MASK` in `app_se_manager_tamper_disable.h`) to the hardcoded configuration (default levels in table above).


The default value of `TAMPER_DISABLE_MASK` is `0x00fa0000` so PRS7, PRS6, PRS5, PRS4, PRS3, and PRS1 are restored to the default level 0 (Ignore) after running the disable tamper command.


## Tamper Settings




| Setting | User value in this example |
| --- | --- |
| Filter - trigger threshold | 4 |
| Filter - reset period | ~33 seconds |
| Flags | Digital Glitch Detector Always On: Disabled |
| Reset threshold | 5 |

* `sl_se_get_status`
* `sl_se_read_otp`
* `sl_se_init_otp`
* `sl_se_validate_key`
* `sl_se_get_storage_size`
* `sl_se_generate_key`

## Getting Started


1. Upgrade the kit’s firmware to the latest version (see `Adapter Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
2. Upgrade the device’s SE firmware to the latest version (see `Secure Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
3. Open any terminal program and connect to the kit’s VCOM port (if using `Device Console` in Simplicity Studio 5, `Line terminator:` must be set to `None`).
4. Create this platform example project in the Simplicity IDE (see [Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/start-a-project#examples) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide, check `Platform()` checkbox to browse the platform examples).
5. Build the example and download it to the kit (see [Simple Build](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/building#simple-build) and [Flash Programmer](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/flashing#flash-programmer) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
6. Run the example and follow the instructions shown on the console.


## Additional Information


1. The hard-coded private command key is an insecure method so the user should find a way to import the signed access certificate for tamper disable.
2. The device should disconnect from the debugger when running this example.
3. **Warning:** Loading the tamper configuration and a public command key into the SE are a **ONE-TIME-ONLY** process. Both of these assignment operations are irrevocable and persist for the life of the device.
4. The default optimization level is `Optimize for debugging (-Og)` on Simplicity IDE and `None` on IAR Embedded Workbench.
