description: > 
  This example project demonstrates the use of the Simple MPU module. Its purpose is to block
  the execution of code from RAM in order to prevent code injection attacks. In this example, 
  some fake malicious executable code is copied to RAM and executed with the MPU disabled and 
  re-enabled to demonstrate its effectiveness.
