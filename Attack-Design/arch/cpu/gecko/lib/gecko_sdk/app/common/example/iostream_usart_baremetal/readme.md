# IOStream USART Bare Metal

This example project demonstrates the use of UART communication over the virtual COM port (VCOM) in a bare metal environment using I/O stream service. The example will echo back any charaters it receives over the serial connection. The VCOM serial port can be used over USB or by connecting to port 4902 if the kit is connected via internet.

## Requirements

Silicon Labs board with USB port or ethernet port.
