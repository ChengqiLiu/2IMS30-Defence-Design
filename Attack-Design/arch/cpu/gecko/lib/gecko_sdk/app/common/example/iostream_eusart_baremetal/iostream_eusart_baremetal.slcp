label: Platform - I/O Stream EUSART Bare-metal
description: >
  This example project uses the I/O Stream service running in a bare-metal configuration 
  to demonstrate the use of EUSART communication over the virtual COM port (VCOM). The 
  application will echo back any characters it receives over the serial connection. The 
  VCOM serial port can be used either over USB or by connecting to port 4902 if the kit 
  is connected via Ethernet.
