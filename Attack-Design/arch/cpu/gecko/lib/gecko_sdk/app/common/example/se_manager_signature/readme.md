# SE Manager Digital Signature (ECDSA and EdDSA)


This example uses the SE Manager API to perform the digital signature (ECDSA and EdDSA) on the supported Series 2 device.


In this example, SE Manager is used first to generate a public/private key pair using a given Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) curve. The private key is then used to sign the hash of a message buffer. The signature is then verified using the public key.


The example redirects standard I/O to the virtual serial port (VCOM) of the kit. By default, the serial port setting is 115200 bps and 8-N-1 configuration.


The example has been instrumented with code to count the number of clock cycles spent in different operations. The results are printed on the VCOM serial port console. This feature can be disabled by defining `SE_MANAGER_PRINT=0` (default is 1) in the IDE setting (`Preprocessor->Defined symbols`).


## Key Type


The following key types are supported in this example:


* Plaintext key in RAM
* Wrapped key in RAM (Secure Vault High only)
* Volatile key in SE (Secure Vault High only)


## Payload Size


The following payload sizes are supported in this example:


* `PLAIN_MSG_SIZE`/16
* `PLAIN_MSG_SIZE`/4
* `PLAIN_MSG_SIZE`


The default `PLAIN_MSG_SIZE` is `4096`, it is defined in `app_se_manager_signature.h`.


## Elliptic Curve Key


The following elliptic curve keys are supported in this example:


##### `ECC Weierstrass Prime` :


* SECP192R1 - 192-bit
* SECP256R1 - 256-bit
* SECP384R1 - 384-bit (Secure Vault High only)
* SECP521R1 - 521-bit (Secure Vault High only)
* SECP256K1 - 256-bit (Custom, Secure Vault High only)


##### `ECC EdDSA` :

* Ed25519 - 256-bit (HSE only)


## Hash Algorithm


The following hash algorithms are supported in this example:


* `SHA-1`
* `SHA-224`
* `SHA-256`
* `SHA-384` (Secure Vault High only)
* `SHA-512` (Secure Vault High only)


## SE Manager API


The following SE Manager APIs are used in this example:


* `sl_se_init`
* `sl_se_deinit`
* `sl_se_init_command_context`
* `sl_se_deinit_command_context`
* `sl_se_get_random`
* `sl_se_validate_key`
* `sl_se_get_storage_size`
* `sl_se_generate_key`
* `sl_se_delete_key` (Secure Vault High only)
* `sl_se_ecc_sign`
* `sl_se_ecc_verify`


## Getting Started


1. Upgrade the kit’s firmware to the latest version (see `Adapter Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
2. Upgrade the device’s SE firmware to the latest version (see `Secure Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
3. Open any terminal program and connect to the kit’s VCOM port (if using `Device Console` in Simplicity Studio 5, `Line terminator:` must be set to `None`).
4. Create this platform example project in the Simplicity IDE (see [Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/start-a-project#examples) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide, check `Platform()` checkbox to browse the platform examples).
5. Build the example and download it to the kit (see [Simple Build](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/building#simple-build) and [Flash Programmer](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/flashing#flash-programmer) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
6. Run the example and follow the instructions shown on the console.


## Additional Information

1.  The HSE Secure Vault Mid devices require SE firmware v1.2.11 or higher (EFR32xG21) and v2.1.7 or higher (other HSE devices) to support hardware acceleration on `Ed25519`.
2.  The default optimization level is `Optimize for debugging (-Og)` on Simplicity IDE and `None` on IAR Embedded Workbench.
