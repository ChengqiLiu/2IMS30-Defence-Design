label: Platform - Joystick Bare-metal
description: >
  This example project uses the Joystick Driver running in a bare metal configuration to
  demonstrate the use of Joystick driver by printing joystick position after every finite
  interval over the virtual COM port (VCOM). The VCOM serial port can be used either over 
  USB or by connecting to port 4902 if the kit is connected via Internet.

  Important Note: This application only works when Wireless Pro Kit (BRD4002A) is used as 
  mainboard to mount and connect the compatible Radio Board.
