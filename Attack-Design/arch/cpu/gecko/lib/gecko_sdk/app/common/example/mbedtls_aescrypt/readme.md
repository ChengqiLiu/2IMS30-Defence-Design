#  mbedTLS AES Example



 This example uses hardware accelerators of the supported devices to perform AES encryption and
 decryption on the supported device.



##  Getting Started



 Build the example and flash it to a supported device. Open a terminal emulator and follow the
 instructions shown on the console.


 When starting the application, you will get the option to run the program in encryption mode or
 decryption mode.


 In ecryption mode, the example will ask you for a short phrase to generate an initial vector
 used in the AES encryption process. You may type any phrase ended by newline or limited to a maximum
 of 16 bytes. After the short phrase, start typing the message to be encrypted, followed
 by a newline to mark the end of the message. The message length is limited to the #define
 MAX\_MESSAGE\_SIZE\_ENCRYPTION. The program will encrypt the message (plaintext), and print out the
 ciphertext, preceded with the initial vector of 16 bytes and followed by a message digest tag of 32 bytes.
 All data is converted to hexadecimal readable text format before sent to the serial port.
 
 The format is as follows:


 Initial Vector(16 bytes) | Ciphertext | Message Digest Tag (32 bytes)


 You can copy the output and feed it back to the program for decryption later. You must
 reset the kit in order to run decryption mode.


 In decryption mode, the example expects to receive a decrypted message in the same format as
 generated by the encryption, terminated by a CR (Carriage Return, ASCII code 13).


###  Turning off the Hardware Acceleration


 To check the performance gain of the hardware acceleration, switch it off by
 switching the value of **Enable hardware acceleration of crypto operations** in the component *Mbed TLS
 common functionality*. This is found under the tab *SOFTWARE COMPONENTS* → *Platform
 → Security*. 


**Useful tip:** Filter on *Configurable Components* and *Installed Components* to
 find the configuration file more easily. 





##  Additional Information



 The AES is operations are accelerated by the CRYPTO AES accelerator.


 The SHA operations are accelerated by the CRYPTO SHA-256 accelerator.


 The example redirects standard I/O to the VCOM virtual serial port.You can use a
 terminal emulator program to connect to the serial port with the default settings of 115200-8-N-1.
