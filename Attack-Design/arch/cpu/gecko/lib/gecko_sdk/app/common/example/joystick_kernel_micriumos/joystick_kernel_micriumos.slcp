label: Platform - Joystick on Micrium OS kernel
description: >
  This example project uses the Joystick driver running in a Micrium OS kernel 
  task to demonstrate the use of Joystick driver by printing joystick position 
  after every finite interval over the virtual COM port (VCOM). The VCOM serial 
  port can be used either over USB or by connecting to port 4902 if the kit is 
  connected via Internet. 

  Important Note: This application only works when Wireless Pro Kit (BRD4002A) is used as 
  mainboard to mount and connect the compatible Radio Board.
