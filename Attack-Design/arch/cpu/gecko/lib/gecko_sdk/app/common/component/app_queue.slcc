description: >
  The Application Queue simplifies the implementation of homogeneous queues. It provides 
  an API for static allocation of fixed-size elements. The implementation is based on a 
  circular buffer of fixed-size items. A buffer overflow callback can be passed to the
  queue in order to handle overflow events as requested.
