description: >
  Simple Application Scheduler helps handling events and scheduling tasks for execution.
  It can be used to enqueue task functions with specified data from interrupt and other 
  contexts and then to run them strictly from the main loop - when running on bare metal.
  Data is stored in the memory management implementation component that can be static or dynamic.
  The API of the component enables to pause and resume the execution.
  The component also uses Power Maneger to prevent sleep when there is a triggered task to be executed.
