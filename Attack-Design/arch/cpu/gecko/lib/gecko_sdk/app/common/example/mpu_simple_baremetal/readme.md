# MPU Simple Bare Metal

This example application demonstrates the use of the simple Memory Protection Unit (MPU) module. The main purpose of the MPU module is to block code execution from RAM in order to prevent malicious attacks.
The application shows differences between malicious attacks in both MPU-disabled and MPU-enabled situations.

## Requirements

Silicon Labs board with MPU module.
