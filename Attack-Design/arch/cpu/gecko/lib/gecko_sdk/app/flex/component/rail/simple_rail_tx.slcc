description: "Adds minimalist RAIL transmit functionality with a RAIL event callback (only Tx events are handled) and a transmit state machine.
              The transmit event can be triggered via cli (Simple RAIL Tx CLI), button press (Simple RAIL Tx Button), etc.
              The payload and the channel is hardcoded.
              The component can be used with Blink and Flex (RAIL) - Empty Example applications only."
