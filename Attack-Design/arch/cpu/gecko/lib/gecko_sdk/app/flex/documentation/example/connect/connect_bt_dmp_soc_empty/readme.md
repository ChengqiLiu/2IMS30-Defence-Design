# Connect: Empty Example DMP

## Introduction

The Connect Empty Example DMP project is a boilerplate code for starting DMP
(Dynamic Multi-protocol) applications in which Connect and Bluetooth stacks
co-operate. From Connect's point of view, the example application does not do
anything except initializing the Connect stack, and only the absolutely
necessary components are installed. On the Bluetooth side, it initializes the
stack and implements basic functions, and adds some CLI commands for basic
Bluetooth operations and Bluetooth parameter configuration.

## Prerequisites

The provided method is applicable for any EFR32 device which supports Bluetooth
**and** Proprietary protocols.

## Prepare the Application

Open the *Connect Bluetooth DMP - SoC Empty* through Simplicity Studio
project wizard.

Compile the code and download it to two (or optionally more) radio boards.

## Testing the Application

Since the application does not utilize the Connect stack, LEDs, buttons, without
modification only the Bluetooth-related functions can be tested. Additionally,
the application can be tested by debugging the compiled code.

To test the Bluetooth functions a BLE-capable device is necessary (a client that
can connect to the Connect Empty Example DMP (Bluetooth server) application) for
example a mobile phone that supports BLE).

### Examples of Extending the Application

The first step to being able to establish communication between devices is to
configure the network.

If the network was configured previously, the network parameters can be
retrieved by the
[`emberNetworkInit()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-network-management#ga47f3cf943b5e9890fa016d871943c705)
API function.

Otherwise, the network must be configured to one of the three supported modes
(*(Extended) Star Mode* / *Direct Mode* / *MAC Mode*) using the network
management API calls (the order of the API calls below does not reflect the
modes):

- [`emberJoinCommissioned()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-network-management#gaf8bbf94c1a141948a2385316fe8caec1)
- [`emberJoinNetwork()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-network-management#gaa87bbe048e8e1c8adeb89c9962305f96)
- [`emberJoinNetworkExtended()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-network-management#ga261299d4f87e26f7ed76c9e8297f9bde)

Connect uses callbacks to notify the application about various events. One of
these events is the incoming message that can be retrieved by implementing the
[`emberAfIncomingMacMessageCallback()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-app-framework-common#ga33ea9e454ca4af7cc66e64a0f0203ccf).
Implementing this callback the application will be able to process the received
messages.

To send a message the application can call
[`emberMessageSend()`](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-message#ga13fe76cafa6f769497cc6a684c96de6e).

The preferred way of executing single or re-occurring operations is to create
events as described in the [event
documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/connect-stack/latest/group-event).

The above is not a comprehensive list of the Connect API rather a few frequently
used functions.

## Notes

Take extra care when designing DMP applications as not all protocols are
compatible with each other. Since the EFR32 devices have a single radio
simultaneous transmit or receiving on different channels / with different PHYs
are not possible, one protocol uses the radio exclusively, furthermore, the
hardware needs time to switch between protocols.

Regarding DMP in general please navigate to [UG305: Dynamic Multiprotocol Userâ€™s
Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug305-dynamic-multiprotocol-users-guide.pdf).

Describing Bluetooth details is out of the scope of this document. For Bluetooth
please consult Silicon Labs Bluetooth materials.

## Conclusion

Although the example does not do anything spectacular, it is an ideal starting
point for an application that exploits the Connect and Bluetooth stacks
capabilities but the implementation needs to start from scratch.
