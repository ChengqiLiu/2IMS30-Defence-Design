# Wi-SUN - SoC CoAP Meter

The Wi-SUN CoAP Meter sample application demonstrates the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol to emulate a metering-like application. The CoAP Meter's purpose is to send sensor measurements to a CoAP Collector device in the same Wi-SUN network. It also shows an implementation example of an application layer library on top of the Wi-SUN stack (i.e., CoAP).

## Getting Started

To get started with Wi-SUN and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG181: Wi-SUN SDK Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg181-wi-sun-sdk-quick-start-guide.pdf).

The Wi-SUN CoAP Meter sample application exposes a command-line interface to interact with the Wi-SUN stack. The goal of this procedure is to create the Wi-SUN network described in the following figure and have the CoAP Collector monitor the CoAP Meter.

To get started with the example, follow the steps below:

* Flash the "Wi-SUN Border Router" demonstration to a device and start the Border Router.
* Create and build the CoAP Meter project.
* Flash the CoAP Meter project to a second device.
* Create and build the CoAP Collector project.
* Flash the CoAP Collector project to a third device.
* Using Simplicity Studio, open consoles on both the Meter and Collector devices.
* Wait for the CoAP Collector and Meter to join the Wi-SUN Border Router network.

Refer to the associated sections in [QSG181: Wi-SUN SDK Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg181-wi-sun-sdk-quick-start-guide.pdf) if you want step-by-step guidelines for each operation.

## Send Sensor Data to a CoAP Collector

The three Wi-SUN devices (Border Router, CoAP Meter, CoAP Collector) are now part of the same Wi-SUN network. Refer to the *Wi-SUN - SoC CoAP Collector* readme to configure the CoAP Collector. When the CoAP Meter receives a request from the CoAP Collector, the CoAP packet is output in the console.

    [Request packet]
    {
    token_len:      0
    coap_status:    0
    msg_code:       1
    msg_type:       0
    content_format: 0
    msg_id:         7
    payload_len:    0
    uri_path_len:   11

    token:

    uri_path:
    measurement

    payload:
    }

The CoAP Meter application replies with a packet of its own containing sensor data. The sensor data consists of actual temperature and relative humidity sensor measurements from the SI7021 IÂ²C sensor and dummy lux values. The response CoAP packet is output in the console.

    [Response packet]
    {
    token_len:      0
    coap_status:    0
    msg_code:       69
    msg_type:       0
    content_format: 50
    msg_id:         7
    payload_len:    63
    uri_path_len:   12

    token:

    uri_path:
    /measurement

    payload:
    {
    "id": 1,
    "temp": 28.23,
    "hum": 29.98,
    "lx": 512
    }

    }

This CoAP packet is sent to the CoAP Collector and is output in the CoAP Collector console on reception.

## Get Sensor Data using libcoap Client over a Backhaul Connection

Any CoAP client that has IPv6 connectivity with the Wi-SUN CoAP Meter can retrieve the sensor metering data.

Using libcoap you can also toggle the board LEDs and discover the attributes hosted by a CoAP server.
 Please refer to  [AN1332: Silicon Labs Wi-SUN Network Setup and Configuration](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1332-wi-sun-network-configuration.pdf) for more information.


## Troubleshooting

Before programming the radio board mounted on the WSTK, ensure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side), as shown.
