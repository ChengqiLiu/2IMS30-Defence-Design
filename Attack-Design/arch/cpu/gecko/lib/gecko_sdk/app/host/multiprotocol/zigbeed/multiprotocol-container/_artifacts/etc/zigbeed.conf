# These configurations are read by Zigbeed at startup. 
# They are the same as the Zigbeed command line arguments.
# Command line arguments passed to zigbeed at startup will
# override the values in this file.

# Radio url
# Mandatory
# The radio url is set of parameters passed to the Spinel driver.
# When Spinel is run over UART or SPI, it is used to configure the link.
# Zigbeed sends Spinel to CPCd, which configures the serial link in
# /etc/cpcd.conf. Thus the only radio-url parameter that is used by
# Zigbeed is the interface id (iid), which is used to differentiate
# between multiple networks using the same RCP. The iid must be set
# to a value between 1 and 3 and must be unique for each host process
# using the multi-PAN 802.15.4 RCP.
radio-url=spinel+cpc://cpcd_0?iid=1

# EZSP interface
# Mandatory
# The name of the PTY device Zigbeed opens to send and receive EZSP messages
# with the host application. The name does not matter, but the PTY device
# must be created using socat prior to starting Zigbeed, eg:
# socat pty,link=/dev/ttyZigbeeNCP pty,link=/tmp/ttyZigbeeNCP    
ezsp-interface=/tmp/ttyZigbeeNCP

# Debug level
# Optional
# The debug level for the Spinel driver.
# Message are sent to syslog if the syslog service is running.
# All messages with level less than or equal to the supplied value are logged.
# For example, setting debug-level=5 logs all messages.
# 0=NONE, 1=CRIT, 2=WARN, 3=NOTE, 4=INFO, 5=DEBG
# Uncomment to enable.
# debug-level=5

# Verbose
# Optional
# Print the Spinel driver log messages to stderr in addition to syslog.
# The trailing = sign with no value is the correct syntax.  The systemd
# template provided with Zigbeed redirects stdout and stderr to
# /var/log/zigbeed/zigbeed.log.
# Comment to disable.
verbose=
