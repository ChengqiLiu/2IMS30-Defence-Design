description:
  "This component contains the core files needed for any project using Mbed TLS, \
  as well as common header and source files.\n

  Algorithms need to be enabled in order to be supported. This is done by \
  including the components corresponding to the wanted primitives, key types, \
  functionality, etc. that live in the different 'Platform|Security|Mbed TLS' \
  subcategories.\n

  Based on the selected sub-components, the Mbed TLS configuration file will be \
  auto-generated and included where necessary."

  # Inclusion of source and config components depends on which TZ state we are
  # targeting. For apps that do not make active use of TZ, a dummy state
  # (trustzone_unaware) should be used.

  # Assume that projects are TZ unaware unless a state is explicitly included.
  # The condtion on device ensures that the recommendation does not exist before
