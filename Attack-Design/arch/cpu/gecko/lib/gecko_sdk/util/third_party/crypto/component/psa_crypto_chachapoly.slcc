description:
  "This component provides support for authenticated encryption and decryption \
  with ChaChaPoly in the PSA Crypto AEAD APIs.\n

  NOTE: There exists a special case which Silicon Labs' crypto acceleration driver \
  cannot handle: that is the case where both the message- and additional authenticated \
  data lengths are equal to zero. If the user needs zero data length, they will \
  need to include the 'ChaChaPoly' component under the Platform|Security|\
  Mbed TLS|Authenticated Encryption category in order to include fallback to the \ 
  software implementation in the Mbed TLS library."
