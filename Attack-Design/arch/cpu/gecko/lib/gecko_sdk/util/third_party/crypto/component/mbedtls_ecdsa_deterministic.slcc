description:
  "This component provides support for signature generation and verification with \
  deterministic ECDSA using Mbed TLS.\n

  WARNING: Adding support for deterministic ECDSA through Mbed TLS will preclude \
  regular ECDSA operations using the Mbed TLS API from being accelerated on Series-2 \
  devices. ECDSA operations on those devices using the corresponding PSA API are \
  unaffected."
