label: Default Entropy Source
description: >-
  This component can be used in order to make sure that a suitable component for
  an entropy source is included in the project. Depending on the device's
  capabilities, this can be either a hardware (TRNG, Radio or ADC) source, or a
  device-unique seed in non-volatile storage.
