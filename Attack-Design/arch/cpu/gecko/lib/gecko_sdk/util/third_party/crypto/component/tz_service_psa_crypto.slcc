description: >-
  This component includes the PSA Crypto core support for TrustZone secure library.
category: Platform|Security|TrustZone
quality: beta

provides:
  - name: tz_service_psa_crypto

requires:
  - name: tz_service_common
    condition: [trustzone_secure]

  # We need to include all of these components since they contain the source
  # files that could possible be required for software fallback. Since the
  # config is created based on the components included for the NS app, this does
  # not add any unnecessary code size.
