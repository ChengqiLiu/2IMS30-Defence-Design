description: >-
  This component provides support for key derivation using PBKDF2 through a Silicon
  Labs custom API integrated into PSA Crypto. PBKDF2 based on AES_CMAC_PRF_128 is only
  supported on EFRxG23/EFMxG23 and newer devices. The builtin PBKDF2 implementation of
  PSA Crypto is not yet available.
