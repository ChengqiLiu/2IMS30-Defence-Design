# Provide the desired memory configuration for the TrustZone Non-secure application.

# Note: the lower boundary of the non-secure memory region (marking the end
# of the secure/non-secure callable memory region) needs to be aligned with a
# granularity of 4K Bytes. This is a hard requirement stemming from hardware
# limitations. Additionally, there is a soft requirement on the boundary to be
# aligned at a flash page boundary. If this is not respected, the first part
# of the NS application (that shares a flash page with the secure memory
# region) will be locked as part of the TZ setup routine. This should not be a
# problem for most applications though, since there should not be any need for
# manual flash writes to this area.
