description: >
  This component provides commands for users to set data channel
  classification, enable or disable the privacy mode and accept list filtering
  features. In the privacy mode, the address resolving functionality is provided
  by the Bluetooth host. As a result, the accept list filtering does not work
  with advertisers that use resolvable private addresses (RPA). RPA addresses
  may be rejected by the filtering since they are unknown to the controller.
