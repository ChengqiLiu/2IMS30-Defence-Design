package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  This Bluetooth advertising component, corresponding to the "advertiser" class
  in Bluetooth APIs, is the base of legacy, extended and periodic advertisings.
  Functionalities in this component include advertising set creation, advertising
  parameter and address settings etc. The application must choose which advertising
  types are needed based on its use cases.
  The <bluetooth_feature_legacy_advertiser> component provides the legacy advertising
  feature. The <bluetooth_feature_extended_advertiser> component provides the extended
  advertising feature. And the <bluetooth_feature_periodic_advertiser> component provides
  the periodic advertising feature.
  When the <bluetooth_feature_legacy_advertiser>, <bluetooth_feature_extended_advertiser>,
  or <bluetooth_feature_periodic_advertiser> component is included by the application, some
  commands of the "advertiser" class whose behaviors vary by specific advertising types
  are no longer supported. See the Bluetooth API reference for more details. When none
  of the three components is included, all commands of the "advertiser" class are
  functional for providing the backwards compatibility.
