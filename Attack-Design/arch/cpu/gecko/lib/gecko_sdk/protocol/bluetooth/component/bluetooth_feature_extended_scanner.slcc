description: >
  This component brings in necessary functionalities for scanning the advertisements
  that use legacy or extended advertising PDUs.
  
  Include this component if the application needs to scan advertisements that
  use extended advertising PDUs. When this component is included by
  the application, advertisements received by the scanner are reported with the
  BGAPI sl_bt_evt_scanner_legacy_advertisement_report event for legacy advertising
  PDUs, and the sl_bt_evt_scanner_extended_advertisement_report event for
  extended advertising PDUs.

  If the application only needs to scan for advertisements that use legacy advertising
  PDUs, the application should use the component <bluetooth_feature_legacy_scanner>.
