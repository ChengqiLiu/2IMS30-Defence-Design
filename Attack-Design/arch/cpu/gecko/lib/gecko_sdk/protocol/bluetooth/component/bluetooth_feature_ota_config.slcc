  OTA configuration

  Provides commands to configure OTA device name, address and flags etc. This
  configuration is used by the Apploader binary application for OTA DFU on EFR
  series 1 devices. Configurations are stored in the NVM and the Apploader reads
  them when the device is booted in the OTA mode.

  This configuration is not available to the Apploader on series 2 devices.
  On series 2, the Apploader runs in the Bootloader as a communication plugin,
  and the configuration can be implemented in the Apploader application directly.
