package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  The component provides Even Connection Distribution algorithm which has been
  designed to be used especially with applications involving several concurrent
  connections. The algorithm tries to distribute the connections such a way
  they are distributed over the time as evenly as possible without overlapping,
  and all connections should get equal, fair share of the air interface resource.
  For optimal performance the algorithm user should
  * initiate the first connection with the longest connection interval if
    all connections do not have the same interval.
  * set the connection intervals of the other connections such that they are, or
    allow (via min-max range), integer fractions of the first interval.
  * make the first interval long enough such that all connections would fit within
    the interval with reasonable transmission time.
  Despite of the above recommendations the algorithm, and the connections, can be
  expected to work with different parameterization but performance is not likely
  optimal.
