  Bluetooth dynamic GATT database feature

  This component enables dynamically creating a GATT database with Bluetooth APIs.

  Dynamically-created GATT attributes could coexist with a static database that
  is generated from a GATT XML file. When a static database is configured to be
  included (by the SL_BT_GATTDB_INCLUDE_STATIC_DATABASE configuration), its
  attributes are added at the beginning of the attribute table when Bluetooth
  stack starts. New services and characteristics created dynamically are appended
  into the attribute table after the static ones.

  Dynamically-created services and characteristics do not support the capability
  feature (Polymorphic GATT) that was designed for the static database solution.

  See the configuration of this component and the Bluetooth API reference manual
  section "GATT Database" for more details.
