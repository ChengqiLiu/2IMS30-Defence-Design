package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  The Bluetooth scanning component, corresponding to the "scanner" class
  in Bluetooth APIs, is the base of legacy and extended scannings and it
  provides functionalities that are common in legacy and extended scannings.

  The <bluetooth_feature_legacy_scanner> component enables scanning the advertisements
  using legacy advertising PDUs. The <bluetooth_feature_extended_scanner> component
  enables scanning the advertisements using legacy or extended advertising PDUs.
  When the <bluetooth_feature_legacy_scanner>, or <bluetooth_feature_extended_scanner>
  is included by the application, some superseded commands of the "scanner" class
  are not available to use. See the Bluetooth API reference for more details. When none
  of these two components is included, all commands of the "scanner" class are
  functional for providing the backwards compatibility.
