package: Zigbee
description: This component requires the Network Creator Security + the Network Creator or the Network Steering
  component to function correctly in Zigbee 3.0 networks.  Else, the Network Find component is
  strongly recommended but not mandatory.) This code hooks up button 0 to have
  specific behavior based on the current network state. The behavior is as follows.
  If the device is not joined to a network, it forms a Zigbee 3.0 network (via
  the Network Creator component) if it is configured as a coordinator, or joins a Zigbee 3.0
  or ZHA legacy network (via the Network Steering component) if it is configured as a router.
  If the device is joined to a network, then pressing the button broadcasts a ZDO
  permit join to allow new devices to join.  Holding the button for 5 seconds and
  releasing causes the device to leave the network.  Button 1 is not used and
  a callback is provided to another module wishing to use it.
