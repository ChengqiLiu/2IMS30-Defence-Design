description: This component utilizes behavior defined in the specification, but not tested
  in compliance, to update the trust center link key of legacy HA devices. This component
  makes use of the Device Database component to be notified when a device joins the
  network of a trust center. When a node joins, this component checks the stack revision
  of the node. If the node's stack revision is not R21 or greater, the component 
  forcefully updates the joining device's trust center link key via a Transport Key
  APS command. Note that this component is meant to be using on a trust center only (i.e.,
  not on a joining device).
