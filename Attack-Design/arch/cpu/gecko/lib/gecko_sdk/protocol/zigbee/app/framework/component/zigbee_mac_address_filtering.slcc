package: Zigbee
description: This component artificially limits what the stack hears by filtering
  the packets just above the lower MAC. The component can be configured on the fly via
  CLI with the short or long address of devices whose packets will be dropped or allowed. There
  are two lists, a short address list (2-byte node ID) and a long address list (8-byte
  IEEE address). Each list may be configured as either an allow list or deny list. The
  default is a deny list with no addresses configured (accept all packets normally). There
  is also a separate option to allow or drop packets with no address information (e.g.
  Beacon Requests). NOTE The radio will still generate and process MAC Acks for
  packets. This component cannot be used to effect the behavior of MAC Acks, which are
  handled by the RAIL library and radio hardware.
