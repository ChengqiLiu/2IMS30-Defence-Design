package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of general response commands. The component is only
  intended to assist with debugging, as the implemented callbacks simply parse incoming
  general response commands and print the results. Before production, this component
  should be replaced with code that acts on the responses in an appropriate way.
