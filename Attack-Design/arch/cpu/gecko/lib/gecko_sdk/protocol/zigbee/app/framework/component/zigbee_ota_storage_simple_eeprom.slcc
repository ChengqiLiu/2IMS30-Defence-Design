package: Zigbee
description: This is a driver for the Over-the-air simple storage module component. It
  uses an EEPROM as the underlying storage device. It provides a means to record
  data being read or written, as well as metadata with information about
  how far along a client download is. It can be used either by an OTA Client or an
  OTA Server. Note that this component assumes that the flash storage does not have read-modify-write support. Users should ensure this value matches the flash storage device used by the application. A mismatch between the project-configured value and the actual flash storage support value will result in an application that asserts upon startup.
