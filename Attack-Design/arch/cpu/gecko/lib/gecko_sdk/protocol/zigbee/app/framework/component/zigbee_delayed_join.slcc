package: Zigbee
description: This component is used both for a trust center and a joining device.  It provides
  a set of APIs for setting the acceptable delay for receiving a network key, as well
  as sending the network key on demand from the app. The following are
  the minimum conditions to verify before successfully using this component. 1. The trust center must have an
  acceptable version of a link key for the joining devices. 2. The component must be (re-)activated
  every time a network is opened or after any other event that changes the trust center (re-)join
  policy.
