package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of the original Zigbee Light Link profile
  enhancements to the Scenes client cluster. The component is only intended to assist
  with debugging, as the implemented callbacks simply parse requests from the Identify
  client and blink LEDs. Before production, this component should be replaced with
  code that acts on the requests in an appropriate way. Note that the extensions do
  not now require Touchlink commissioning to be used, and that the commands may now
  be required by other device types, such as Lighting and Occupancy.
