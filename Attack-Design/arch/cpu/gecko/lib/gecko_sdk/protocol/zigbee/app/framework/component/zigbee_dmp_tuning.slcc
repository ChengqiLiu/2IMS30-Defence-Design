description: Certain networking stack configurations can be crucial for proper networking
  operation in multiprotocol use cases, such as transmission,
  reception, connection and advertisement priorities. This component provides better
  access to such stack configuration options, to help in tuning and
  testing a DMP application. It provides three DMP configuration profiles for three
  major use cases. These are Bluetooth LE (BLE) priority, Zigbee priority, and balanced priority.
  These provide priority for BLE-over-Zigbee transmission and reception, priority for Zigbee-over-BLE connection, advertisement etc., and to provide
  and a balanced priority configuration option, respectively. The component also provides
  a way for users to manually configure the default value of these configuration options
  (component option inputs) or to change them at run time over the CLI.
