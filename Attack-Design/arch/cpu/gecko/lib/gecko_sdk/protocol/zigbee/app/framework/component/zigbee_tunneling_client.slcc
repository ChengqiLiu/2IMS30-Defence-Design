description: Silicon Labs implementation of Tunneling client cluster.  This component requires
  extending to integrate the software that processes the tunneled data.  Note
  if the maximum transfer size requires fragmentation, manually include
  the Fragmentation component and configure it to support the tunnel data size.  Additionally,
  the component uses the address table to communicate with the server, so you must manually
  configure the address table size so that it accommodates active tunnels managed by
  this component as well as any other entries created during normal operation.
