package: Zigbee
description: A component implementing the client-side functionality of the Smart Energy
  1.2 Events cluster. The component is only intended to assist with debugging as the
  implemented callbacks simply parse responses from the Events server and print the
  results.  Before production, this component should be replaced with code that acts
  on the responses in an appropriate way.
