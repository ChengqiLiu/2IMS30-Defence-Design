description: This is a Trust Center component that handles updating
  the Network Key by UNICASTING that key to each device encrypted with their link
  key. It is intended for use in Smart Energy networks. It will traverse the Trust
  Center's local key table and sends the new NWK key to each non-sleepy device with
  an authorized link key (a device that has successfully performed key establishment). The
  new network key will be randomly generated. After all messages have been sent,
  it will broadcast a key switch message.
