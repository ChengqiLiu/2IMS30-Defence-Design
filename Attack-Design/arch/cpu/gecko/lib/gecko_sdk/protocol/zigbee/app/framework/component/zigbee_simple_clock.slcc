package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of a simple clock. The component provides time keeping
  functionality to the framework and the application through implementations of both
  emberAfGetCurrentTimeCallback and emberAfSetTimeCallback.  When the application
  knows the current time (e.g., by reading the time attribute from a time server),
  it should call emberAfSetTime to keep the component synchronized. The component is not
  a substitute for an accurate clock and is only intended for use during development.  Before
  production, this component should be replaced with code that provides more accurate
  time.
