description: "Silicon Labs implementation of reporting. Reports are asynchronous messages
  sent out when a ZCL attribute has changed. This component supports both requesting
  reports from another device and sending out attribute reports when the device has
  been configured to do so. If the application will receive reports from multiple
  sources, Silicon Labs recommends configuring it as a concentrator. Note: This component only
  supports the binding-based interpretation of reporting in which reports are sent
  to corresponding entries in the binding table. Either the node sending the reports,
  the node receiving the reports, or another third-party configuration device may
  create the binding table entry(s) on the reporting node. For more details, 
  refer to the Application Framework Developers Guide for the current SDK version."
