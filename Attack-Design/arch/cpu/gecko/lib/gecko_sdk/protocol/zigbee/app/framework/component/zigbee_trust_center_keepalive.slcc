description: Silicon Labs implementation of Trust Center Keepalive for SE 1.2b. The component
  periodically sends keepalive signals to the trust center to verify that it is
  accessible. If the trust center fails to acknowledge a series of keepalive signals,
  the component searches for another instance of the trust center on a different channel
  or short PAN ID. The frequency with which the component sends the keepalive signals
  has a default, but is ultimately determined by the attributes on the Trust Center. This
  component periodically reads the "TC Keep-Alive Base" and "TC Keep-Alive Jitter"
  to determine the rate that it will send future keepalives. Trust Center Keepalive
  is part of the optional Trust Center Swap-Out feature of Smart Energy 1.1. Devices
  are not required to implement this functionality. The trust center does not send
  keepalives, so this component should be disabled if the device is acting as the trust
  center.
