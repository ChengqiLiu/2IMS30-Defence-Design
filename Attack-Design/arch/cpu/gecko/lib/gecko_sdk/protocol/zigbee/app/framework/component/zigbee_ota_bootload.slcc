description: This component provides the platform-specific means to bootload a device
  with an application bootloader using external storage for the new image. For an
  SOC platform this will simply execute the bootloader. In that case it is assumed
  that the SOC bootloader can access the same storage device as the run-time application
  using the bootload cluster (i.e. they both have the same EEPROM driver). For the
  NCP, the code is more complex but functionally the same.  This host code launches
  the bootloader on the NCP, transfers the file over to the NCP via the xmodem protocol,
  then reboots the NCP.  It is assumed for the NCP that the serial standalone bootloader
  appropriate for the platform (UART or SPI) is loaded.  The NCP code requires an
  OTA Storage implementation and device. This component does not support any host bootloading,
  or bootloading other microchips, but it can be extended to do so.
