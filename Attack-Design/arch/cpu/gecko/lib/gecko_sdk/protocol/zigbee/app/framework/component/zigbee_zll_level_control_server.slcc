package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of the original Zigbee Light Link profile
  enhancements to the Level Control server cluster. The component is only intended to
  assist with debugging, as the implemented callbacks simply parse requests from the
  Identify client and blink LEDs. Before production, this component should be replaced
  with code that acts on the requests in an appropriate way. Note that the extensions
  do not now require Touchlink commissioning to be used, and that the commands may
  now be required by other device types, such as Lighting and Occupancy.
