description: Silicon Labs implementation of Partner Link Key Exchange. Partner Link Key
  Exchange is a feature in Smart Energy where a device may obtain an APS link key
  with another, non-trust center device. This code handles the necessary process
  to request a link key with a partner device, then contact the trust center and ask
  it to generate a new link key and send it securely to both devices.
