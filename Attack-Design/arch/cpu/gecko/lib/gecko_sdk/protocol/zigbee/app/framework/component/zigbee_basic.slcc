package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of the Basic server cluster.  This component implements
  the optional ResetToFactoryDefaults command, which allows any remote device in the
  network to reset the local device.  When the application receives this command,
  the component resets attributes managed by the framework to their default values
  and then calls a callback so that the application can perform any other necessary
  reset-related operations. The command is disruptive and not required, so Silicon Labs
  recommends disabling this component for most production applications.
