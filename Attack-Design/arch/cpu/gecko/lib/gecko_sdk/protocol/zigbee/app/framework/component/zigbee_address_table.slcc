package: Zigbee
description: This component supports managing the address table. On the SoC,
  all action are directly performed on the stack address table. The host
  maintains a copy of the address table and ensures that it is always in sync with
  the NCP's address table. When building the HOST, 
  make sure that the NCP can support the address table size in the component configuration. This
  optimal size varies based on platform architecture and size of other dynamically-
  allocated data for this application. If errors occur upon resetting the NCP,
  the NCP may not have enough room to store a large
  address table size. If this is not the case, the NCP may not be able to dynamically
  increase the address table size based on the host's request. To work around
  this issue, statically allocate the desired address table size on the Zigbee Pro Stack\Pro
  Leaf Stack components on the NCP.
