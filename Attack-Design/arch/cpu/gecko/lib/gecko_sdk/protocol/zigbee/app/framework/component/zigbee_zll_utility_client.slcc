package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of the ZLL Utility client cluster. The component
  is only intended to assist with debugging, as the implemented callbacks simply parse
  responses from the ZLL Utility server and print the results. Before production,
  this component should be replaced with code that acts on the responses in an appropriate
  way.
