package: Zigbee
description: This is a dummy component that is a precondition to building a GBCS-compatible
  application. It does not provide any code of its own. Instead, it a) allows other components 
  to add conditional code base on the presence of this component, in cases where GBCS contradicts
  the Smart Energy specification, and b) enables the inclusion of other GBCS-related
  components.
