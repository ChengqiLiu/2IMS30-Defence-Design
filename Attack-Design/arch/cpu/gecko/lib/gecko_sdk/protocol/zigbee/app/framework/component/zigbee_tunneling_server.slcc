description: Silicon Labs implementation of Tunneling server cluster.  This component requires
  extending to integrate the software that processes the tunneled data.  Note
  if the maximum transfer size requires fragmentation, manually include
  the Fragmentation component and configure it to support the tunnel data size.  Additionally,
  the component uses the address table to communicate with clients, so you must manually
  configure the address table size so that it accommodates active tunnels managed by
  this component as well as any other entries created during normal operation. The Tunneling
  cluster test specification suggests that implementations support the test protocol
  (protocol id 199, manufacturer code 0xFFFF). If you do not support it, you need
  some other means of proving two-way communications works and is verifiable. If
  test protocol support is enabled, the component automatically handles requests
  for the test protocol and these messages will not fall through to the application.
