package: Zigbee
description: This component performs the necessary steps to create a network according
  to the Base Device Behavior specification. The component performs an active scan
  followed by an energy scan across a primary channel set to decide which
  channel(s) are valid candidates for network formation. If the component fails to form
  a network on any primary channels, it moves to a secondary channel mask. Before
  every attempt at network formation, this component sets up the stack to use Zigbee
  3.0 security.
