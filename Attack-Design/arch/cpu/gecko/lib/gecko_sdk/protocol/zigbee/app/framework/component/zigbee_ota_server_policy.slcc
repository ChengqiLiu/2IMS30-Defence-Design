description: Silicon Labs implementation of the server policies for the Zigbee Over-the-air
  bootload cluster (a multi-hop, application bootloader). This controls when a client
  can upgrade, when new images are made available, and which version the client will
  download and install. This component should be expanded to support the developer's
  own server policy.
