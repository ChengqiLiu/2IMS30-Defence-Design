description: Silicon Labs implementation of Time server cluster. This component is not recommended
  for production because it uses a software system to keep track of time. Instead
  the user should hook the cluster callbacks into a set of hardware
  routines to maintain the device's system clock. This software implementation is
  inappropriate for sleepy devices since it prevents them from sleeping for longer
  than one second. During initialization, the Time Server component writes the TimeStatus
  attribute based on the component options, overriding any attribute default that may
  have been configured.
