package: Zigbee
description: This component performs the necessary security initialization to form
  a Zigbee 3.0-compliant network. To enable "Allow Trust Center rejoin
  with well known key", the "emberAfPluginEzspSecurityTrustCenterJoinCallback()" function
  (on the NCP side) may need to be implemented. For more details about this callback
  function, see "https//www.silabs.com/community/wireless/zigbee-and-thread/knowledge-base.entry.html/2018/12/26/how_to_allow_unsecur-sa3C".
  If the link does not work, go to our community website and search "How to
  allow unsecure rejoins on the Ember ZNet stack".
