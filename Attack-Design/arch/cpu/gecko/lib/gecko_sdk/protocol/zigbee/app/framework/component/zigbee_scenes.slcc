package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of the Scenes server cluster.  This component supports
  commands for setting up and recalling scenes.  Scenes are stored in a table and
  each scene consists of a set of values for attributes in other clusters. Clusters
  that extend the scene table do so through extension field sets. This component supports
  extensions for the On/Off, Level Control, Thermostat, Color Control, Door Lock,
  and Window Covering clusters. If the application includes any of these clusters,
  the component automatically includes and manages the attributes in those clusters. For
  example, if the application includes the On/Off server cluster, the component
  saves and recalls the On/Off attribute as part of saving or recalling scenes. Some
  ZLL extensions are implemented in this component and will be included automatically
  for ZLL applications. If the ZLL Scenes server cluster component is also enabled,
  this component uses it for handling some additional ZLL enhancements. Otherwise,
  these ZLL extensions are disabled.  This component requires extending in order to interact
  with the actual hardware.
