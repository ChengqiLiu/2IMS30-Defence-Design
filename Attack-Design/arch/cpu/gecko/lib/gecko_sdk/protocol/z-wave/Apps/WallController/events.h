 * Defines events for the application.
 *
 * These events are not referred to anywhere else than in the application. Hence, they can be
 * altered to suit the application flow.
 *
 * The events are located in a separate file to make it possible to include them in other
 * application files. An example could be a peripheral driver that enqueues an event when something
 * specific happens, e.g. when battery level reach a certain level.
